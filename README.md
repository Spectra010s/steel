# STEEL

**code. chat. control.**

Steel is a modular, multi-platform developer tool designed to combine real-time collaboration, Git management, terminal access, and a code editor — all in one unified app.

This repository contains will the **first working module** of Steel: a real-time chat system, built to run both in the browser and inside an Electron desktop shell.

---

## 🚀 Current Module: Real-Time Chat

The chat system allows developers to:
- Send and receive real-time messages
- Prepare for code snippet sharing
- Collaborate via a dedicated sidebar interface

It works via WebSockets (Socket.io) and is deployable for public testing.
